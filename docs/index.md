## Quick start

[Just add the TeleightBots dependency to your project](quick-start#dependencies) and add the following code to your main class:

```java
final String botToken = "your_bot_token_here"; // <-- The bot token from @BotFather
final String botUsername = "your_bot_username_here"; // <-- The bot username

// You custom listener. In this example, we are printing the event whether a generic update is received.
final EventListener<UpdateReceivedEvent> updateEvent = EventListener.ofBuilder(UpdateReceivedEvent.class)
        .handler(event -> System.out.println("UpdateReceivedEvent: " + event.bot().getBotUsername() + " -> " + event))
        .build();

// Register the bot
TeleightBots.getBotManager().registerLongPolling(botToken, botUsername, bot -> {
    bot.getEventManager().addListener(updateEvent);
}
```

And you're good to go!
